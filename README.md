# Pandas-Learning-Project
I am an absolute learner and here I am really excited to share my practices and codes while I keep moving forword through learning Pandas library. My reference for learning Pandas is **Pandas 1.X coocbook a practical recipes for scientific computing, time series analysis, and exploratory data analysis using python** written by **Matt Harrison** and **Theodore Petrou**. I found this book unblievably easy to follow and straightforward. Hope you will stay with me in this amazing journey.
